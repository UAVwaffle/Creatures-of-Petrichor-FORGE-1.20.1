Each mob's spawn rate and location can be easily configured in the mod's configuration file.


### Features:

- Shroomin

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

The Shroomin are mysterious fungi that attack weak travellers by using their caps as clubs.
This has an advantageous side effect of spreading their spores all over the ground and on the corpse of their victim. (*Note: this is just lore, they don't spawn more after killing you)

- Direwolf

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Prefering to hunt in packs, Direwolves are rarely found alone. They rely on their speed, agility, and numbers to overwhelm their prey.

- Haunt

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Haunts are small wooden logs possessed by curious forest spirits. Neutral in nature, Haunts will not attack unless provoked and will alert other nearby spirits when attacked.

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Some Haunts, filled with rage over the loss of their forests, will turn into Shades and seek vengeance on those who would dare harm their home.

- Meadow slime

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Unlike slimes found in the swamp, Meadow slimes are found wandering the plains at night. It is believed that the lower concentration of water in plains biomes caused these slimes to be smaller and more compact. Rumor has it that if one were split, the smaller halves could be tamed. (tameable/bucketable meadow slimes are planned for a future update)

- Vengeful Gravestone

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Forgotten and possessed by hatred and broken memories, the Vengeful Gravestone wanders the night seeking to kill the one responsible for its death. They sometimes drop a placeable Vengeful Gravestone item.

- Specter

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Clinging to its last memory as it fades from existence, the Specter searches the night for anyone who might remember who they were. They will tear your soul apart in a futile attempt to find their memories. (It is planned to make them hold an item inside them and drop it when they are killed; for now, you get slime)

- Wandering Lantern

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Rare but powerful mobs. Wandering Lanterns attempt to snatch your soul to fuel its ever-burning lantern. (Emmisive textures are planned for a future update. Right now, they drop glowstone blocks. They used to be used to add new coins to our private servers' economy, but since nobody wants random coins with their mob mod, now the coins are only accessible in creative.)

- Cursed Doll

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Cursed Dolls were created by the Fae to help deal with human infestations. Filled with hundreds of curses and fired in hate, these clay dolls use magic to deal heavy damage from far distances. It is recommended to use a shield to block their attacks and to attack before they can recharge their curses. (Particle effects are planned for a future update)

- Will O Wisp

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Floating in the forest, these Wisps of light are said to guide travelers deeper and deeper into the forest, trapping them forever. (Emissive textures planned for a future update)

- Sprite

<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Sprites, the eyes and ears of the fae. They prefer to remain in the forest but sometimes sneak into villages and towns to spy on the locals.
